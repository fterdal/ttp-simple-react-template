# ⚛️ TTP React Starter Template

This template is meant to get you started learning React! It uses Webpack and Babel to complile your React code, along with your CSS. You can also use `webpack-dev-server` to preview your React application locally, and the application will rebuild quickly on every file save. By default, the server runs on port 3000.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or fork this repository on GitHub.
2. Install the NPM packages: `npm install`
3. Preview your React app: `npm run start-dev`

If you're curious to see what Webpack is actually sending to the browser, try building the app with `npm start`. Then, look at `public/main.js`. What you find may shock and horrify you. 😱
